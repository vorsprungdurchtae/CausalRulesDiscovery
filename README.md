This repository contains the adjusted code for the experiments conducted in the article
"Process Mining Meets Causal Machine Learning: Discovering Causal Rules from Event Logs"
by Zahra Dasht Bozorgi, Irene Teinemaa, Marlon Dumas, Marcello La Rosa, and Artem Polyvyanyy.

This does not replicate the experiment from the paper, but with own dataset

The dataset of adjusted code for the experiment is pseudo_eventlog_final.csv in the directory /src

To replicate the experiment with the default settings run:

python causal_rules_adjusted.py

The unmodified original implementation as well as the dataset BPIC17_O_Accepted.csv is available in https://github.com/zahradbozorgi/CausalRulesDiscovery

If you want to run the original implementation, you should download the BPIC17_O_Accepted.csv from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9agus6uvwp4plgh/AADe8ZXJipFQf_7x13osu9vza?dl=0 and store it in the additional directory data which locates outsied /src folder.
